Links are the defining feature of the web
because they allow you to move from
one web page to another — enabling the
very idea of browsing or surfing.

You will commonly come across the following types of links:
* Links from one website to another
* Links from one page to another on the same website
* Links from one part of a web page to another part of the
same page
* Links that open in a new browser window
* Links that start up your email program and address a new
email to someone.

WHAT IS A FUNCTION?
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of st atements).

Throughout the remaining chapters of this book, you
will see many more examples that use jQuery.

## ANONYMOUS FUNCTIONS & FUNCTION EXPRESSIONS

Expressions produce a value. They can be used where values are expected.
If a function is placed where a browser expects to see an expression,
(e.g., as an argument to a function), then it gets treated as an expression.
