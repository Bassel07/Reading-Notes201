## Structure
The Structure of
This Book

1: HTML
We will spend the first chapter
looking at how HTML is used to
create web pages. You will see
that you start by writing down
the words you want to appear
on your page. You then add tags
or elements to the words so
that the browser knows what is
a heading, where a paragraph
begins and ends, and so on.
The rest of this section
introduces the tags you have
at your disposal to create web
pages, grouped into chapters on:
text, lists, links, images, tables,
forms, video audio and flash, and
miscellaneous elements.
I should warn you that the
examples in the first nine
chapters are not exciting to look
at, yet they are the foundation of
every web page. The following
chapters on CSS will show you
how to make your pages look a
lot more interesting.

2: CSS
We start this section with a
chapter that explains how CSS
uses rules to enable you to
control the styling and layout
of web pages. We then go on to
look at the wide variety of CSS
properties you can use in your
CSS rules. These properties
generally fall into one of two
categories:
Presentation: How to control
things like the color of text, the
fonts you want to use and the
size of those fonts, how to add
background colors to pages (or
parts of a page), and how to add
background images.
Layout: How to control where
the different elements are
positioned on the screen. You
will also learn several techniques
that professionals use to make
their pages more attractive.

3: Practical
We end up with some helpful
information that will assist you in
building better websites.
We look at some new tags that
will be introduced in HTML5 to
help describe the structure of
your pages. HTML5 is the latest
version of HTML (still under
development at the time of
writing). Before learning about
these elements, you need a good
grasp of how CSS is used to
control the design of web pages.
There is a chapter that talks you
through a design process that
you might like to follow when
creating a new website.
Finally, we end up looking at
topics that will help you once
you have built your site, such
as putting it on the web, search
engine optimisation (SEO) and
using analytics software to track
who comes to your site and what
they are looking at.

## Extra Markup

At this point, we have covered the main
tags that fit nicely into groups and
sections.
In this chapter, we will focus on some helpful topics that are
not easily grouped together. You will learn about:

● The different versions of HTML and how to indicate which
version you are using

● How to add comments to your code

● Global attributes, which are attributes that can be used on
any element, including the class and id attributes

● Elements that are used to group together parts of the page
where no other element is suitable

● How to embed a page within a page using iframes

● How to add information about the web page using the
<meta> element

● Adding characters such as angled brackets and copyright
symbols

## HTML5 Layout

HTML5 is introducing a new set of
elements that help define the structure of
a page.
They are covered here (rather than with the other HTML
elements you met earlier in the book) because you'll find
it easier to understand how they can be used now that you
have seen how CSS can control the layout a page. These
new elements are going to play an important part in creating
layouts going forward. In this chapter you will see:

● The new HTML5 layout elements and their uses

● How they offer helpful alternatives to the <div> element

● How to ensure older browsers recognize these elements
As with all HTML5 and CSS3 content, its usage is still
subject to change but it is already widely being used by web
developers and it is likely that you will want to use them.
  
  ## Process & Design
  
  This section discusses a process that
you can use when you are creating a new
website.
It looks at who might be visiting your site and how to ensure
the pages feature the information those visitors need. It also
covers some key aspects of design theory to help you create
professional looking sites. In this chapter, we will look at:

  ● How to understand the audience your site may attract and
what information they will expect to find on it

  ● How to organize information so that visitors can find what
they are looking for

  ● Design theory for presenting information in a way that
helps visitors achieve their goals

  ● Design tips to help you create more attractive and
professional sites

 ##  Introduction
  
 ### Learning to program with JavaScript involves:
  
 * 1
Understanding some basic
programming concepts and
the terms that JavaScript
programmers use to
describe them.

 * 2
Learning the language itself,
and, like all languages, you
need to know its vocabulary
and how to structure your
sentences.
 
 * 3
Becoming familiar with how
it is applied by looking at
examples of how JavaScript
is commonly used in
websites today. 
  
  
  
  
  
  
 ## The ABC of Programming
  
  
# A B C
  
* A - What is a script and how do I create one?
  
* B - How do computers fit the world around them?  
  
 * C - How do I write a script for a web page?
 

  
 ### Once you have learned the basics, the following chapters will show how the JavaScript
language can be used to tell browsers what you want them to do.
