# Chapter 7: “Forms” (p.144-175)
Traditionally, the term 'form' has referred
to a printed document that contains
spaces for you to fill in information.
HTML borrows the concept of a form to refer to different
elements that allow you to collect information from visitors to
your site.
Whether you are adding a simple search box to your website or
you need to create more complicated insurance applications,
HTML forms give you a set of elements to collect data from
your users. In this chapter you will learn:
* How to create a form on your website
* The different tools for collecting data
* New HTML5 form controls

In addition to enabling users to
search, forms also allow users
to perform other functions
online. You will see forms

when registering as a member
of a website, when shopping
online, and when signing up for
newsletters or mailing lists.

### Why Forms?
The best known form on the web is probably
the search box that sits right in the middle of
Google's homepage.
