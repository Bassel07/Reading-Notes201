# Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM



## Understanding The Problem Domain Is The Hardest Part Of Programming What is the hardest thing about writing code?

### There are many common answers to this question:

* Learning a new technology
* Naming things
* Testing your code
* Debugging
* Fixing bugs
* Making software maintainable


## Why problem domains are hard

Have you ever tried to put together a jigsaw puzzle that didn’t have any picture on it?
How about one like this one, that has a very similar pattern repeated on it and is double-sided?

The reason why puzzles like this one are so hard, is because you can’t really see what you are trying to build very clearly.
Normally when you put together a jigsaw puzzle you follow steps that might look something like this:


1- Figure out what the major components of the picture are
2- Sort the pieces by color or component
3- Put together all the border pieces
4- Put together each component of the picture from the piles you created

## What can you do about it?

If understanding the problem domain is the hardest part of programming and you want to make programming easier, you can do one of two things:
1- Make the problem domain easier
2- Get better at understanding the problem domain

You can often make the problem domain easier by cutting out cases and narrowing your focus to a particular part of the problem.

What I mean by this is that it is often beneficial to take a part of the problem and fully understand that part before expanding the problem domain.

Games are really good at this.  Look at most games today and you’ll find that you start with a very small problem domain.
The first level is usually a tutorial that has a basic set of things you can do so that you don’t get overwhelmed.
But, as you advance through the levels, you usually find they get harder and introduce new concepts that build gradually on what you know,
until you understand a pretty large problem domain.

# Chapter 3: “Object Literals”

## WHAT IS AN OBJECT?
Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model
of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object,
variables and functions take on new names.

### IN AN OBJECT: VARIABLES BECOME
KNOWN AS PROPERTIES
If a variable is part of an object, it is called a
property. Properties tell us about the object, such as
the name of a hotel or the number of rooms it has.
Each individual hotel might have a different name
and a different number of rooms.

### IN AN OBJECT: FUNCTIONS BECOME
KNOWN AS METHODS
If a function is part of an object, it is called a method.
Methods represent tasks that are associated with
the object. For example, you can check how many
rooms are available by subtracting the number of
booked rooms from the total number of rooms.


### This object represents a hotel. It has five properties and one method.
The object is in curly braces. It is stored in a variable called hotel

## WORKING WITH THE DOM TREE

Accessing and updating the DOM tree involves two steps:
1: Locate the node that represents the element you want to work with.
2: Use its text content, child elements, and attributes.
