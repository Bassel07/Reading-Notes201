# About organizations

Organizations are shared accounts where businesses and open-source projects can collaborate across many projects at once.
Owners and administrators can manage member access to the organization's data and projects with sophisticated security and
administrative features.


Organizations include:

* A free option, GitHub Free, with unlimited collaborators on unlimited public repositories with full features and unlimited private
repositories with limited features.

The option to upgrade to GitHub Team or GitHub Enterprise Cloud for additional features, including sophisticated user authentication
and management, and escalated support options. For more information, see "GitHub's products."

* Unlimited membership with a variety of roles that grant different levels of access to the organization and its data

* The ability to give members a range of access permissions to your organization's repositories

* Nested teams that reflect your company or group's structure with cascading access permissions and mentions

* The ability for organization owners to view members' two-factor authentication (2FA) status

* The option to require all organization members to use two-factor authentication

* The option to purchase a license for GitHub Advanced Security and use the features on private repositories.
For more information, see "About GitHub Advanced Security."

## Organizations and enterprise accounts

Enterprise accounts allow owners to centrally manage policy and billing for multiple GitHub.com organizations.

For organizations that belong to an enterprise account, billing is managed at the enterprise account level,
and billing settings are not available at the organization level.
Enterprise owners can set policy for all organizations in the enterprise account or allow organization owners
to set the policy at the organization level. Organization owners cannot change settings enforced for your organization
at the enterprise account level. If you have questions about a policy or setting for your organization,
contact the owner of your enterprise account.

Enterprise accounts are available with GitHub Enterprise Cloud and GitHub Enterprise Server. For more information,
see "About enterprise accounts."

Projects maintained and managed by one sole organization owner can easily become inaccessible if the organization owner is unreachable.
We recommend an organization have at least two people with owner permissions to ensure no one will lose access to a project.
For more information, see "Maintaining ownership continuity for your organization."
