# HTML Lists, CSS Boxes, JS Control Flow

## Chapter 3: “Lists”

There are lots of occasions when we
need to use lists. HTML provides us with
three different types:
* Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is
numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for
a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract
where each point needs to be identified by a section
number.
* Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point
(rather than characters that indicate order).
* Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the
definitions for each of those terms.


## Chapter 13: “Boxes” 

At the beginning of this section on CSS,
you saw how CSS treats each HTML
element as if it lives in its own box.

* Control dimensions of your boxes
* Create borders around boxes
* Show and hide boxes
* Set margins and padding for boxes


By default a box is sized just big
enough to hold its contents. To
set your own dimensions for a
box you can use the height and
width properties.
The most popular ways to
specify the size of a box are
to use pixels, percentages, or
ems. Traditionally, pixels have
been the most popular method
because they allow designers to
accurately control their size.
When you use percentages,
the size of the box is relative to
the size of the browser window
or, if the box is encased within
another box, it is a percentage of
the size of the containing box.
When you use ems, the size
of the box is based on the size
of text within it. Designers
have recently started to use
percentages and ems more for
measurements as they try to
create designs that are flexible
across devices which have
different-sized screens.
In the example on the right, you
can see that a containing <div>
element is used which is 300
pixels wide by 300 pixels high.
Inside of this is a paragraph
that is 75% of the width and
height of the containing element.
This means that the size of the
paragraph is 225 pixels wide by
225 pixels high.

   ## Chapter 2 “Basic JavaScript Instructions”

ARRAYS 
  An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't
just store one value; it stores a list of values.
  
  You should consider using an
array whenever you are working
with a list or a set of values that
are related to each other.
Arrays are especially helpful
when you do not know how
many items a list will contain
because, when you create the
array, you do not need to specify
how many values it will hold.
If you don't know how many
items a list will contain, rather
than creating enough variables
for a long list (when you might
only use a small percentage
of them), using an array is
considered a better solution.
  
For example, an array can be
suited to storing the individual
items on a shopping list because
it is a list of related items.
Additionally, each time you write
a new shopping list, the number
of items on it may differ.

* Conditional statements allow your code to make
decisions about what to do next.
* Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>)
are used to compare two operands.
* Logical operators allow you to combine more than one
set of comparison operators.
* if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code
if a condition is true, and another if it is false.
* switch statements allow you to compare a value
against possible outcomes (and also provides a default
option if none match).
* Data types can be coerced from one type to another.
All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy.
* There are three types of loop: for, while, and
do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements.
