# HTML/CSS book, Ch. 15, “Layout”


In this chapter we are going to look at
how to control where each element sits
on a page and how to create attractive
page layouts.

This involves learning about how designing for a screen can be
different to designing for other mediums (such as print). In this
chapter we will:

* Explore different ways to position elements using normal
flow, relative positioning, absolute positioning and floats.
* Discover how various devices have different screen sizes
and resolution, and how this affects the design process.
* Learn the difference between fixed width and liquid layouts,
and how they are created.
* Find out how designers use grids to make their page
designs look more professional.

# Summary

* <div> elements are often used as containing elements
to group together sections of a page.
  
* Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you
specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
  
* The float property moves content to the left or right
of the page and can be used to create multi-column
layouts.(Floated items require a defined width.)
  
* Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
  
* Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,
and indicate what the site is about within the top 600
pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
  
* Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
  
* CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
  
* You can include multiple CSS files in one page.
